**AIM OF AN CLOCK DIVIDER:**

The aim of a clock divider is to take a high-frequency clock signal and generate a slower clock signal by dividing the input clock frequency by a specified factor. 

This is essential in digital systems where different components may need to operate at various clock speeds. 

1.Frequency Reduction 

2.Synchronization 

3.Power saving 

4.Timing adjustments 

5.Generating multiple clock domains
